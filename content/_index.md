Welcome to my early-2000s inspired corner of the web. Everything here is plain HTML, Hugo, and a single CSS file—no heavy assets, no distractions.

This site is a hub for my work and writing. If you like fast-loading, readable pages and a classic Mac OS X feel, you are in the right place.

Head to the portfolio for project snapshots—from HIPAA-grade systems to embedded builds—and the blog for notes.
