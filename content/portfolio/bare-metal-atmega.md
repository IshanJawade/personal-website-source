summary: "Register-level C firmware to drive GPIO and blink LEDs on the ATmega328P."

Small, dependency-free firmware targeting the AVR toolchain.

- Used avr-gcc and avrdude with Makefile automation for quick compile/flash cycles.
- Manipulated GPIO registers directly and cross-checked against datasheets and schematics.
